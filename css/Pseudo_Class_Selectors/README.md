# CSS Pseudo Class Selectors

Pseudo-classes are powerful CSS mechanisms that let you select multiple elements based off of their order of appearance in the HTML, rather than which classes are applied to them.

1. first
1. last
1. nth-of-type
1. nth-child
1. before
1. after

You can also use them to select an element based on how a user has interacted with it.

1. hover
1. active
1. visited
